Model for the evalUation of sea-LeveL risE and Temperature (Mullet)

Work in progress.
In its current form, this package is meant to be a playground.
It provides a place to explore how a simple climate model could be written if it were to be written from scratch, combining the strengths of numerical computing languages (e.g. Fortran) and higher-level languages (e.g. Python).
