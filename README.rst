Work in progress.

Brief summary
+++++++++++++

In its current form, this repository is meant to be a playground.
It provides a place to explore how a simple climate model could be written if it were to be written from scratch, combining the strengths of numerical computing languages (e.g. Fortran) and higher-level languages (e.g. Python).
Please feel free to make PRs or fork the repository for whatever purpose you like (it's under a BSD license to facilitate this).
The only request we currently make is that you don't use the model name (Mullet) in case we do one day turn this repository into a fully fledged model.
